# 🧮 GeometryOracle Context Enhancement Plan

**Adding Mathematical History, Curiosities, and Research Insights via Optional Flags**

A focused plan to enhance GeometryOracle with educational context while keeping the core experience clean and optional.

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Clean by Default, Rich by Request**
- All existing functionality remains exactly the same
- Context is **opt-in only** via flags/parameters
- Standard API patterns (`?historical=true`, `--context`)
- Progressive disclosure: basic → contextual → research-level

**Target Users:**
- **Students** learning about n-dimensional geometry
- **Educators** teaching mathematical concepts
- **Curious minds** wanting to understand the "why" behind formulas
- **Researchers** exploring connections to current work

---

## 🏗️ Implementation Strategy

### **Flag-Based Context System**

All context features accessible via standardized flags:

**API Query Parameters:**
```bash
POST /api/hypersphere?historical=true
POST /api/hypersphere?curiosities=true  
POST /api/hypersphere?research=true
POST /api/hypersphere?context=all      # All context types
```

**MCP Tool Parameters:**
```python
@mcp.tool()
async def calculate_hypersphere(
    dimensions: int,
    radius: float,
    historical_context: bool = False,
    mathematical_curiosities: bool = False, 
    research_insights: bool = False,
    session_id: Optional[str] = None,
    client_info: Optional[str] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```

**Claude Desktop Usage:**
- *"Calculate a 5D sphere, radius 2"* → Basic calculation
- *"Calculate a 5D sphere, radius 2, with historical context"* → Includes history
- *"Calculate a 5D sphere, radius 2, show me the math curiosities"* → Includes fun facts

    # Parse MCP request
    method = event.get("method")

    # Extract context flags
    historical = params.pop("historical_context", False)
    curiosities = params.pop("mathematical_curiosities", False) 
    research = params.pop("research_insights", False)
    
    # Core calculation (existing logic)
    core_result = handle_geometry_calculation(method, params)
    
    # Add context if requested
    if any([historical, curiosities, research]):
        context_handler = ContextHandler()
        core_result = context_handler.enhance_result(
            core_result, historical, curiosities, research

## 📊 User Experience Examples

### **Basic Usage (Unchanged)**
```
User: "What's the volume of a 7D sphere with radius 2?"
Claude: The volume is 16.77 cubic units.
```

### **With Historical Context**
```
User: "What's the volume of a 7D sphere with radius 2, with historical context?"
Claude: The volume is 16.77 cubic units.

Historical context: You just used Euler's gamma function from 1729! This formula extends the concept of factorials to work with fractional dimensions. The mathematical lineage spans from Archimedes' original sphere work in 250 BCE through Newton's calculus to Euler's breakthrough that made n-dimensional calculations possible.
```

### **With Curiosities**
```
User: "Calculate a 5D sphere, radius 1, show me what's interesting about it"
Claude: The volume is 5.26 cubic units.

Mathematical curiosity: You're incredibly close to the "golden dimension" 5.257 where unit hyperspheres reach maximum volume! This is one of the most beautiful examples of how discrete mathematical patterns hide continuous optimizations. Try calculating the same sphere at dimensions 4, 5, and 6 to see the peak for yourself.
```

### **Full Context**
```
User: "Calculate an 8D sphere, radius 1, with full context"
Claude: The volume is 4.06 cubic units.

Historical: This uses Euler's 1729 gamma function breakthrough...

Curiosity: You're past the golden dimension peak, so volume is decreasing now despite higher dimensions...

Research: Interesting connection - 8D sphere packing was just solved in 2016 by Maryna Viazovska, solving a 400-year-old problem! Your calculation relates to the optimal packing density she discovered...
```
