# 2014 CS102 Sphere Calculator

This project contains a short program from a CS102 class. It computes the
surface area and volume of a sphere based on a user supplied diameter.

## Tasks
- [x] Document how to compile and run the program.
- [x] Summarize expected input and example output.
- [x] Add licensing information to clarify reuse.
- [x] Provide contribution guidelines.
- [x] Update repository description to note that the default branch is `master`.

See **TASKS.md** for a breakdown of how these items can be addressed without
modifying the Java source files.

## Building

Compile both Java files with `javac`:

```bash
javac Sphere.java MultiSphere.java
```

Run the program using `java`:

```bash
java MultiSphere
```

## Usage

The application first demonstrates the surface area and volume of a sphere with
a diameter of one. You are then prompted to enter your own diameter. Example
session:

```
$ java MultiSphere
A sphere with a diameter of 1 has a volume of 0.524, and an area of 3.142.

Please enter the diameter of your sphere.
3
The surface area of a sphere with diameter of 3 is 28.274.

The volume of a sphere with diameter of 3 is 14.137.
```
