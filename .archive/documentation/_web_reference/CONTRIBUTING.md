## ü§ù How to Contribute

### 1. Found a New Issue?

**Document it using the established format:**

#### For AI_AGENT_CI_CHECKLIST.md
```markdown
### X. [Issue Category Name]

**Problem**: [Brief description of the issue]

**Check Steps:**
1. [Specific verification steps]
2. [Commands to run]
3. [Files to check]

**Common patterns to fix:**
```[language]
# WRONG
[incorrect example]

# CORRECT  
[corrected example]
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] [Checklist item 1]
- [ ] [Checklist item 2]
```

#### For LESSONS_LEARNED.md
```markdown
### X. [Problem Title]
**Problem**: [Description of what went wrong]
**Solution**: [How it was fixed]
**Lesson**: [Key takeaway for future deployments]
```

### 2. Fixed a Template Issue?

1. **Update the relevant template files**
2. **Test your fix** with a real deployment
3. **Document the change** in the appropriate file
4. **Update version references** if needed
5. **Submit a Pull Request** with clear description

### 3. Improved CI/CD Workflow?

**Priority: Update validate.yml first**, then document:

1. **Test thoroughly** - Deploy to real environment
2. **Update validate.yml** with working implementation  
3. **Document in AI_AGENT_CI_CHECKLIST.md** - Add systematic debugging steps
4. **Add to LESSONS_LEARNED.md** - Explain why the change was needed
5. **Update README.md** - Add to "Proven Solutions" list if major fix

## üìã Contribution Checklist

### Before Submitting PR:
- [ ] **No secrets** - Scan your changes for API keys, tokens, passwords
- [ ] **Templates work** - Test with fresh project deployment
- [ ] **Documentation updated** - Relevant files reflect your changes
- [ ] **Cross-references accurate** - Links between documents work
- [ ] **Placeholders proper** - Use `[CUSTOMIZE]` format consistently

### Security Requirements:
- [ ] **No hardcoded credentials** in any template
- [ ] **No specific AWS account IDs** or resource identifiers
- [ ] **No internal URLs** or private network references
- [ ] **Example credentials clearly fake** (e.g., `sk-1234567890abcdef`)

### Quality Standards:
- [ ] **Commands tested** - All bash/CLI commands work as documented
- [ ] **Syntax validated** - YAML, markdown, code blocks are correct
- [ ] **Links functional** - All internal references work
- [ ] **Consistent formatting** - Follow existing style patterns

## üéØ High-Value Contributions

### Most Needed Improvements:
1. **New deployment patterns** - Support for additional platforms (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
2. **Security enhancements** - Additional scanning tools and configurations
3. **Performance optimizations** - Faster CI/CD workflows
4. **Accessibility improvements** - Enhanced a11y testing and patterns
5. **Monitoring integration** - Application performance monitoring templates

### Documentation Priorities:
1. **Real-world examples** - More implementation case studies
2. **Troubleshooting guides** - Common error messages and fixes
3. **Architecture decisions** - Why specific choices were made
4. **Tool comparisons** - When to use different approaches

## üîÑ Review Process

### Pull Request Review:
1. **Automated testing** - GitHub Actions validate changes
2. **Template testing** - Maintainers test with real deployments  
3. **Security review** - Manual scan for sensitive information
4. **Documentation check** - Ensure consistency across files
5. **Community feedback** - Other Claude instances may test changes

### Approval Criteria:
- ‚úÖ **Solves real problem** that multiple deployments would face
- ‚úÖ **Tested implementation** - Works in production environment
- ‚úÖ **Clear documentation** - Other Claude instances can follow it
- ‚úÖ **No security risks** - No credentials or sensitive data
- ‚úÖ **Consistent style** - Matches existing template patterns
