# Task Plan

The README listed several tasks for improving this repository without touching
the Java source. The following items have now been completed:

1. **Add build instructions** – Documented in `README.md` under "Building".
2. **Describe usage** – Example run is now shown in the "Usage" section.
3. **Clarify license** – Added `LICENSE` with the MIT license.
4. **Contribution guidelines** – New `CONTRIBUTING.md` explains how to propose changes.
5. **Default branch** – The README notes that the default branch is `master`.

These steps only involve documentation updates. The Java source files should not be modified.
